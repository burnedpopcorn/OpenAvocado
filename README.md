<br>
by burnedpopcorn180

GameMaker Version Used: ```2024.14.1.210```

Packages Included:
- Gameframe
- GMLive
- GifHx
- GMEXT FMOD v1.1.0
- Retro Palette Swapper
- rtShell
- NekoPresence

### NOTES
This is a decomp of the "Wasted" build of WSB, which isn't the most updated build. 
<br>
The latest build can't be decompiled since it was YYC compiled, and I didn't decompile thanksgivingremix because I was incorrectly told that Wasted was newer at the time of making this.

(Probably could recreate latest tho...)
